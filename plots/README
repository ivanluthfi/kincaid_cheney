                 Instructions for making plots
                 -----------------------------

I.   Introduction

    The maing of the plots involves three steps:

  (a) compile and run the corresponding Fortran program to produce a file
      containing the data to be plotted. The data represent (X,Y) coordinates
      of the function at sample points.

  (b) run a plotting program which takes the data file as input and produces
      a plot file in postscript. I used gnuplot on the math machines. For each
      figure, I wrote a script file containing the set of gnuplot instructions 
      required to produce the plot file. All that is needed is to invoke the 
      gnuplot command in the directory containing the files. Then at the gnuplot
      prompt type load "myscript" (including the double quotes).

   (c) print the postscript file using the laser printer. Note that the 
       postscript file can be edited to improve the plot (resizing, margins,
       resizing symbols,etc).

    These three steps are illustrated for the figure fig11-2 in the following
    section II.


II.  Illustration: How to produce fig11-2

  (a) Compile fig11-2.f90.
      Run the executable file and  redirect the output to fig11-2.dat

  (b) start gnuplot
      type load "make11.2" (include the double quotes) at the gnuplot prompt
      this will produce a postscript file fig11-2.out containing the fig11-2. 
      the figure can be previewed by using the unix command
       gs fig11-2.out 
      (in usual unix environment), after exiting from gnuplot.

    (c) print the plotfile by using any postscript printer.


    Remarks
    -------

    (a) the postscript file fig11-2.out can be edited. in particular to change
        the size of the symbols plotted, one can modify the definitions of the
        /vpt and /hpt (at lines 14 and 15 of fig11-2.out). For instance a
        modification from

        /hpt 31.5 def
        /vpt 31.5 def

        to

        /hpt 12. def
        /vpt 12. def

        will produce smaller nicer symbols.

    (b)
        Each line of the script plotting instruction file make11.2 can be typed
        directly interactively at the gnuplot promt. It is more convenient to
        put the instructions in a script file and load the script file instead.

    (c) more than one plot can be produced during a single gnuplot session. In 
        this case it may be desirable to clear gnuplot definitions between plot
        by using the "clear" command (incorporated into the make11.2 file)

    (d) in order to direct the plot onto the terminal screen (from the gnuplot
        program) instead of creating the postscript plotfile, delete the first 
        two lines from the file make11.2 before loading it. You may then need
        to set the unix display variable, and create the postscript file using
        the psfix command from unix.


 III. Creating the other plots

   (a)  All of the above informations apply equally to the other figures.

     The only exeption is fig7-7, which requires two programs, each of
     which producing the data points for one part of the curve.
     both of fig7-7a.f90 and fig7-7b.f90 should be run first,
     their respective output redirected to fig-7-7a.dat and fig7-7b.dat,
     before using gnuplot (load "make7.7") to produce fig7-7.out
     make7.7 inputs both data files and output the combined plotfile 
     fig7-7.out.

     Note also that each program for the figire in Chapter 7 produces a 
     (knot) file containing the function values at the knot points. These
     can be printed or incorporated into the text.
