# Maple symbolic manipulation of nested or
# Horner polynomial:
 
 poly := a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d;
 convert(poly, horner, x);

# This can also be done with the package
# 'numapprox' within Maple for the numerical
# approximation of functions:

 with(numapprox):
 f :=x -> a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d;
 hornerform(f);
